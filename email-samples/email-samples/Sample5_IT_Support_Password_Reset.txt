PHISHING INDICATORS IDENTIFIED:
====================================================================

1. FRAUDULENT SENDER DOMAIN

   - Uses unofficial .tech TLD
   - Legitimate IT: it@company.com or itsupport@company.com
   - Domain spoofing attempt

2. EXTERNAL PASSWORD PORTAL
   - Link: company-portal-login.tech
   - Legitimate password changes occur through internal systems
   - Never through external domains
   - Accessed via VPN or intranet, not email links

3. IMMEDIATE DEADLINE
   - Account suspension threat by 6:00 PM today
   - Same-day deadline creates panic
   - Legitimate IT policies provide reasonable notice
   - Designed to bypass critical thinking

4. CREDENTIAL HARVESTING TACTIC
   - Instructions to "login with current credentials"
   - ⚠️  This is how attackers steal BOTH old and new passwords
   - Legitimate password resets don't require old password via link
   - Captures credentials before user creates new one

5. MASS DISTRIBUTION
   - Sent to "all-employees@company.com"
   - Indicates phishing campaign
   - Real password policies are communicated through official channels
   - Usually personalized for actual mandates

6. GENERIC GREETING
   - "Dear Company Employee" (not personalized)
   - No employee name or ID
   - No department information
   - Mass-targeting indicator

7. URGENCY + AUTHORITY
   - "Mandatory" language
   - "Security audit" justification
   - Suspension threat
   - Psychological manipulation

====================================================================
ATTACK EXPLANATION:
====================================================================

This is an IT Support Impersonation attack designed to steal 
corporate credentials. The attack is particularly effective because:

WHY IT WORKS:
1. Employees trust IT department communications
2. Password security is a known corporate requirement
3. Fear of account suspension drives compliance
4. Technical language adds legitimacy
5. Urgency bypasses verification instincts

THE CREDENTIAL THEFT PROCESS:
1. Victim clicks malicious link
2. Fake login page appears (looks like company portal)
3. Victim enters CURRENT username and password
4. Attacker captures existing credentials
5. Victim is prompted to create "new" password
6. Attacker captures new password too
7. Attacker now has full access with current credentials

WHAT ATTACKERS DO WITH CREDENTIALS:
✗ Access email accounts
✗ Steal sensitive company data
✗ Launch internal phishing campaigns
✗ Access financial systems
✗ Steal intellectual property
✗ Install backdoors for persistent access
✗ Conduct lateral movement across network
✗ Sell credentials on dark web

====================================================================
HOW TO IDENTIFY LEGITIMATE IT COMMUNICATIONS:
====================================================================

LEGITIMATE IT PASSWORD RESETS:
✓ Come from official company domain (@company.com)
✓ Provide reasonable advance notice (days, not hours)
✓ Direct to internal portals (accessed via bookmarks or VPN)
✓ Never request current password through email links
✓ Include specific employee details (name, department, ID)
✓ Can be verified by calling IT Helpdesk
✓ Follow established company procedures

RED FLAGS:
✗ External domains or suspicious TLDs (.tech, .xyz, .top)
✗ Same-day deadlines or immediate threats
✗ Links to external password portals
✗ Requests to "verify" with current credentials
✗ Generic greetings without personalization
✗ Cannot be confirmed through known IT channels

====================================================================
RECOMMENDED ACTION:
====================================================================

IF YOU RECEIVE THIS EMAIL:
1. DO NOT click any links
2. DO NOT enter any credentials
3. DO NOT forward or reply
4. Report to IT security immediately
5. Delete email from inbox and trash
6. Verify actual password policy through official channels

VERIFICATION STEPS:
1. Call IT Helpdesk at known extension (from company directory)
2. Check company intranet for official announcements
3. Ask manager about password policy changes
4. Never verify through email links or unknown numbers

IF YOU ALREADY CLICKED AND ENTERED CREDENTIALS:
🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:

1. DISCONNECT from network immediately (Wi-Fi and Ethernet)
2. CONTACT IT Security at extension 5500
3. CHANGE password through legitimate internal portal
4. ENABLE multi-factor authentication (MFA) if available
5. MONITOR account for suspicious activity
6. DOCUMENT what information was entered
7. PREPARE for potential password reset across all systems

DO NOT:
✗ Shut down computer (preserves evidence)
✗ Try to "fix" it yourself
✗ Wait to report (time is critical)
✗ Hide the incident (no penalty for reporting)
