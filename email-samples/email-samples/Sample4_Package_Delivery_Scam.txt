ATTACK EXPLANATION:
====================================================================

This phishing scam exploits the prevalence of online shopping and 
package deliveries. The attack works because:

1. Many people regularly expect package deliveries
2. Curiosity prompts clicks even without ordering
3. Urgency and fees create pressure to act
4. Package tracking is routine and trusted

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU CLICK:

Scenario 1: CREDENTIAL THEFT
- Fake login page requesting email/password
- Credentials harvested and sold
- Used to compromise actual accounts

Scenario 2: PAYMENT FRAUD
- Fake "redelivery fee" payment form
- Requests credit card information
- Financial theft and identity fraud

Scenario 3: MALWARE DOWNLOAD
- Fake "tracking app" download
- Installs malware on device
- Data theft and system compromise

====================================================================
HOW TO VERIFY LEGITIMATE DELIVERY NOTIFICATIONS:
====================================================================

✓ Check if you're actually expecting a package
✓ Verify tracking number on official carrier website
✓ Look for personalized details (your name, address)
✓ Check sender email domain carefully
✓ Contact carrier directly using official phone number
✓ Never click links - go directly to carrier's website

LEGITIMATE DELIVERY EMAILS INCLUDE:
- Your full name and delivery address
- Specific order details or sender information
- Official company domain (fedex.com, ups.com, usps.com)
- Consistent branding and professional formatting

====================================================================
