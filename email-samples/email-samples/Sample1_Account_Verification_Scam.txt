ANALYSIS NOTES:
====================================================================

This is a classic credential phishing attack. The attacker creates
a fake login page that captures usernames and passwords when victims
attempt to "verify" their accounts.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:
- DO NOT click any links
- DO NOT enter credentials
- Report to IT security immediately
- Delete the email
- Verify account status through official channels only
