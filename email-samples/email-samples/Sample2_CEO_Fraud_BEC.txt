Sarah,

I'm currently in a meeting with potential investors and need you to 
process an urgent wire transfer for a time-sensitive acquisition 
opportunity.

Please wire $85,000 to the following account immediately:

Account Name: Strategic Ventures LLC
Account Number: 9847562301
Routing Number: 021000021
Bank: International Commerce Bank

This is confidential - do not discuss with anyone until the deal is 
finalized. I'll explain everything when I return to the office 
tomorrow.

Please confirm once the transfer is complete.

Thanks,
Michael Roberts
CEO

ANALYSIS NOTES:
====================================================================

This is a Business Email Compromise (BEC) attack, also known as 
"CEO Fraud" or "Whaling." The attacker impersonates a senior 
executive to authorize fraudulent wire transfers.

According to FBI statistics, BEC attacks resulted in over $2.7 
billion in losses in 2022 alone.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:
- DO NOT process wire transfer
- Verify request through phone call to CEO (use known number)
- Follow standard financial authorization procedures
- Report to IT security and management immediately
- Document the attempt

VERIFICATION PROTOCOL:
1. Call the executive using a known phone number
2. Verify through multiple channels (not email)
3. Follow established wire transfer procedures
4. Get written authorization through official channels
